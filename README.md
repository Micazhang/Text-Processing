# Text-Processing


1. Use classes BruteForceMatch, BoyerMoore and KMP provided in the source code.
a. Download file Hard disk.txt from the Resources.
b. Find all occurrences of patterns “hard”, “disk”, “hard disk”, “hard drive”, “hard dist” and “xltpru”, and show the offsets.
c. Repeat (b) 100 times and record the average CPU time for each case.
d. Compare the CPU times with the running times of the three algorithms (discussed in class) and comment on asymptotic running time of the corresponding algorithms.


2. Download file Protein.txt from the Resources. Using class TST provided in the source code:
a. Write a program that reads file “Protein.txt” and creates a trie using TST. Use StringTokenizer, Jsoup or a similar API to extract the words from the file.
b. Do several searches of keys “protein”, “complex”, “PPI”, “prediction”, and others, and show the occurrences of these words in file Protein.txt
